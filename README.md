Formative Assignment for Unit-1


All instructions for this assignment are contained in this file

Note, this assignment is not autograded, also it is formative so it is to serve as practice and an opportunity to gain feedback.
Use this assignment to help you in finishing the summative assignment.



## Problem

Edit the file "formative_1.py"

In this file do the following.

- Create a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
- Ask the user to guess a number in the list
- If the user guesses a number that is in the list then write a message like this "good guess ____ is in fact in this list" (the blank should be the number that was guessed)
- If the user guesses incorrectly, print a message like "sorry, please try again"
- allow the user to keep guessing numbers until they get a number right



### The summative assignment will be an addition onto this program, so if you want to do well then finish this code first.
