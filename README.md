# Unit-1-Summative-2023
Summative Assignment for Unit-1


All instructions for this assignment are contained in this file

Edit the file "summative_1.py"
In this file do the following.

You are required to extend or add on to what you did for the formative assignment, below are the instructions for the formative portion that you should have already completed.

## Formative part

- Create a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
- Ask the user to guess a number in the list
- If the user guesses a number that is in the list then write a message like this "good guess ____ is in fact in this list" (the blank should be the number that was guessed)
- If the user guesses incorrectly, print a message like "sorry, please try again"
- allow the user to keep guessing numbers until they get a number right


## Summative 

- keep track of all the users guesses in 2 lists
- one list should hold all the guesses the user made that are less than the number they guessed correctly
- the other list should contain all the guesses the user made that are greater than the number they guessed correctly
- example, random list [0,5,7,34,75,19], user guesses [25, 1, 16, 11, 4, 7], less than list [1,4], greater than list [25,16,11]
- display the following lists at the end, "user guesses", "less than", "greater than"



### Part 2 Oral defense

All summative assignments will have an oral defense portion.
This gives you a chance to answer questions, explain your thought process, understanding of the problem and approach to solving it
This gives you an opportunity to get some marks even if you didn't necessarily complete the solution.
Schedule for oral defenses TBD.


Good luck!
